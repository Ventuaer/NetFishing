# NetFishing
Demake of WebFishing, the social game found on steam, for the 3DS. Please check out the original creator of the game.

## Disclaimer
I am not a gamedev, I have not studied to be a gamedev. This project is not supposed to be used for gamedev learning, but maybe for learning how to make one for the 3DS on unity. The ID of the game is all zeros so if you have an app on your 3DS/citra with also an unchanged ID, it will get overwritten when you install it. I will fix it later down the line, for now it is as is. I provide no guarantee for it working ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (it might crash but it shouldn't brick your system).

End of disclaimer, let's move onto the fun stuff.


You can find the latest release in the main folder, called `build.cia` - it is already decrypted for the real system. If you see a .cci or .3ds file around, that means the file is not decrypted and you have to do it yourself using gm9 decrypt->encrypt and you will be able to install it, or use a simple CIA converter, but either way you will have to find a real 3DS (firmware) to convert the file.
